SKA SDP Parametric Model
************************

The SDP parametric model is a collection of equations and software
code that model the performance aspects of the SDP. We created an
interactive software interface for performing computations and
displaying their results so that people both within and external to
SDP can easily interact and experiment with the model. This is
accomplused using Python and Jupyter notebooks, which are documented
below.

A central goal of the notebooks is to compute performance metrics and
general sizing estimates for the SDP. Refer to the parametric model
document for the fundamental choices of which algorithms are
modelled. The basic assumption is that we employ a combination of
w-snapshots and w-stacking combined with facetting for distribution.
