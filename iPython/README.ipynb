    "# The SKA SDP Parameteric Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This series of notebooks is the user interface into the SKA SDP parameteric model. The purpose of the parametric model is to parametrise SDP pipelines for the various scientific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this realistically, the parametric model especially contains a significant amount of performance modelling. This is both so we can optimise parameters to be \"realistic\" with respect to our architecture (partly done automatically) as well as exploring the impact of parameters on costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To serve this goal of exploration, the parametric model contains a lot of separate notebooks, mostly born out of specific enquiries done in the past. This notebook should act as a guide to newcomers trying to find their way around."
