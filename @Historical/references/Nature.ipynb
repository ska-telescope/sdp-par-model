The sliders allow you to adjust the frequency of the underlying periodic sine wave signal (represented by `frequency`), and also how often the signal is sampled (represented by `grid_points`). Get it wrong, and a high-frequency sine wave is measured as a lower-frequency signal.\n\nTo see the effects of aliasing:\n\n1. Run the next cell, then set the `grid_points` slider to `13`.\n2. Move the `frequency` slider to values above `10`.\n3.
