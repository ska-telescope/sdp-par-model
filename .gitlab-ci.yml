# Execute all available code. Most of our "tests" are actually the
# notebooks, so we use the nbval extension to pull them into py.test.
# This has the advantage that we can generate coverage statistics for
# the entire thing.
#
# Unfortunately, there currently seems to be some flakiness to this:
# Sometimes a notebook fails to start, reporting "RuntimeError: Kernel
# didn't respond in 60 seconds". There's open tickets on similar
# issues, so maybe this is going to away eventually. For the moment,
# simply retrying a couple of times seems to fix it. This likely means
# that we spin a bit if something goes wrong systematically, but
# better than dealing with random false positives...
