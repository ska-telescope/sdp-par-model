===SKA SDP Performance Model===

This repository contains iPython and Maxima models 
that model the SKA Science Data Processor performance

The purpose of these models is primarily to deduce the required amount of 
storage, processing power and power that are needed to build the SDP.
These parameters in turn inform the cost estimates of the SDP compute platform.
