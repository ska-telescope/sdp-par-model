* Maxima 

I currently use Maxima (http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) version 5.32
(current version in Ubuntu 14.04, easy to install on all other
systems). Usually it is best for newcomers to use the newest official
version and let me know of any problems.

* Support file compmodel.max

Most of the definitions of relations are done from within LaTeX
document in somewhat of a literate programming style. However there is
a support file (compmodel.max) that contains some pure maxima
supporting code. This file should be loaded before any other work is
done.

* Emaxima 

The tex files are maintained using Emacs and emaxima mode. The
emaxima.el comes with the Maxima package. See below for doing
computations without using emaxima mode.

* Extract Maxima code from .tex files

The following command (using awk) will extract all the maxima inputs from a 
.tex file and create wxMaxima workbooks:

    awk -f dump_maxima_code.awk MajCycleModel.tex    > MajCycleModel.wxm
    awk -f dump_maxima_code.awk DataFlow.tex         > DataFlow.wxm
    awk -f dump_maxima_code.awk CompHWPowerModel.tex > CompHWPowerModel.wxm

(You will need to install awk if you do not have it already).

If you want to use plain Maxima code, you can use instead

    awk '/\\begin{maxima}/{a=1;next}/maximaoutput/{a=0}a' latexfile.tex

for each TeX file. You can then feed that extract into Maxima 
in oder to do interactive computations.

You can edit the TeX file directly then, paste the input into maxima
and paste output back into emacs after the maxima output line.
