* Maxima 

I currently use Maxima (http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) approximately
version 5.30 (strictly: branch_5_30_base_110_ga2815dc). Probably best
to go for the newest official version and let me know of any problems.

* Emaxima 

The tex files are prepared using Emacs and emaxima mode. The
emaxima.el comes with the Maxima package. See below for doing
computations without using emaxima mode. 

* Extract Maxima code from .tex files

The following awk program will extract all the maxima inputs from a 
.tex file:

awk '/\\begin{maxima}/{a=1;next}/maximaoutput/{a=0}a' mytexfile.tex

(You will need to install awk if you do not have it already). Feed
this extract into Maxima and then you can do interactive computations.

You can edit the TeX file directly then, paste the input into maxima
and paste output back into emacs after the maxima output line.
